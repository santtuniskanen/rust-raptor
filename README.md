# Rust Raptor

![Rust Build](https://github.com/santtuniskanen/rust-raptor/actions/workflows/rust_build.yml/badge.svg)

#### Rust Raptor is a Command Line tool emulating the classic grep tool from UNIX based systems. This is a project in [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) book.

## Goals
The aim of this project is to learn how to make Command Line applications with Rust, as well as writing tests and reading files. This project will never be as complete as [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), but I'm aiming to add more features as I go along.
